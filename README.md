## Portfolio Features

This portfolio includes several key sections:

Biography Page
I am an aspiring Software Quality Assurance (SQA) professional with a strong foundation built from a B.S. in Information Systems (BSIS) and an Associate in Computer Technology. My educational background provides a critical dual perspective: the Associate degree delivered hands-on technical proficiency in system configuration, troubleshooting, and IT infrastructure, enabling me to accurately isolate and document technical defects.

Complementary to this, the BSIS equipped me with a strategic mindset in Systems Analysis and Design, focusing on how technology solutions must align with business needs. This unique combination ensures I don't just find bugs, but also assess whether the software meets the overall functional and strategic business requirements. I am eager to apply my analytical skills and dedication to detail to ensure product excellence and enhance the user experience.
